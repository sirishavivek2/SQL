1) Show 5 rows from order: Show 5 rows from the orders.

  SELECT * FROM ORDER LIMIT 5;

2) Select specific columns - Return order id, order date, and sales for all orders

  SELECT order_id, order_date, sales_amount FROM orders;

3) Filtering with WHERE - Show orders with sales greater than 100.

    SELECT ORDER_ID, SALES_AMOUNT FROM ORDERS WHERE SALES_AMOUNT > 100;

4) Date Filter(year) - Orders placed in 2024

    SELECT * FROM ORDERS WHERE ORDER_DATE BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31';

5) Sorting Results - Top 10 largest orders.

    SELECT ORDER_ID, SALES_AMOUNT FROM ORDERS ORDER BY SALES_AMOUNT DESC LIMIT 10;

6) Distinct - List unique store ID's present in orders

    SELECT DISTINCT STORE_ID FROM ORDERS;

7) Basic Aggregation - Total sales across all orders

    SELECT SUM(SALES_AMOUNT) AS TOTAL_SALES FROM ORDERS;

8) Group By (per-store totals) - Total sales and order count per store

    SELECT STORE_ID, SUM(SALES_AMOUNT) AS TOTAL_SALES, COUNT(*) AS ORDER_COUNT FROM ORDERS GROUP BY STORE_ID;

9) Having (filter aggregates) - Stores with total sales > 100,000.

    SELECT STORE_ID, SUM(SALES_AMOUNT) AS TOTAL_SALES FROM ORDERS GROUP BY STORE_ID HAVING SUM(SALES_AMOUNT) > 100000;

10) Aliases for readability - 

    SELECT O.STORE_ID, SUM(O.SALES_AMOUNT) AS TOTAL_SALES, COUNT(*) AS ORDER_COUNT FROM ORDERS O GROUP BY O.STORE_ID;

11) Inner Join - Show orders with customer names. Tables: orders, customers.

  SELECT O.ORDER_ID,O_SALES_AMOUNT,C_CUSTOMER_NAME FROM ORDER 0  JOIN CUSTOMER C  ON O.CUSTOMER_ID = C.CUSTOMER_ID;

12) Left join (preserve left table) - All orders + customer name if avaialble

  SELECT O.ORDER_ID, O.SALES_AMOUNT, C.CUSTOMER_NAME FROM ORDER O LEFT JOIN CUSTOMER C ON O.CUSTOMER_ID = C.CUSTOMER_ID;
